- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rob5604
- 👀 I'm a US educated and trained MD with clinical experience in Orthopedic Surgery, Anesthesiology, and Primary Care. I was a US Navy Medical Officer.
- I co-founded jomi.com, a video journal of surgical techniques
- I'm a barely literate programmer, trying to use AI to help me build useful applications
- I'm super fascinated by AI. It is undoubtably the biggest phenomenon of my lifetime
- I do not work clinically at this time. I am more interested in helping people obtain maximum health through modalities such as optimal nutrition, sleep and proper circadian rhythm, strength, mobility and VO2 max workouts, sunlight, the avoidance of environmental toxins, meditation, breath work, cold therapy, sauna.

- 💞️ Medicine is changing very rapidly. Technology, especially information technology has had and will continue to influence medical care, but paradoxically we in the US are experiencing an epidemic of metabolic disease, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and psychological problems.
- The answer to these problems is proper preventive care and the avoidance of pharmaceutical and surgical solutions as much as possible.
- I had to experience my own health issues in order to understand that I was missing a huge part of the picture.
